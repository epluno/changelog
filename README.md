## Long-Term Objective

⬖ scrd is not a venture-backed start-up looking for an easy out or exit, we are looking to change the standards in e-commerce, by becoming the defecto and go-to solution for commmerce. Our goal is to provide an API first, modular stack to deliver flexibility that scales. With a post `v1.0.0` we plan to introduce a set of tools covering advanced features and use-cases regarding Point-of-Sale, Stock management, Data Analysis, Machine Learning, and many other sub-systems. 

##  A World, Post v1.0.0

 ⬖ scrd will continue following [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) , with a development release schdule for major, minor, and patch releases. This schedule will span every 12 months for **major releases**, every 6 weeks for **minor releases**, and every 2 weeks for **patch releases**. 

>Given a version number **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH**, increment the:[^cite-1]
>
>1. **MAJOR** version when you make incompatible API changes,
>
>2. **MINOR** version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and
>
>3. **PATCH** version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.

Additional labels for `pre-release`and build metadata are used as extensions to the **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH** format. An example of a pre-release is `alpha`, `beta`, and `rc` *(release candidate)*.

The below table is a breakout of the Semantic Versioning system:

| Identifier | Major | Minor | Patch | Pre-Release Identifier |    Release    |
| :--------: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :--------------------: | :-----------: |
|     v      |   0   |   5   |   1   |          beta          | `v0.5.1-beta` |



#### How our changelog works

Just like our versioning convention our changelogs follow a standard format based on [Keep A Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/). Our only modification is on how we manage the changelog - We outline a generalized view of our roadmap and it showcased under the **Unreleased** section, while keeping the current version at the top of document. 

Under each release we will provide a list of changed known as [types](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/#types) made during the release. 

## From beta to v1.0.0

The objective of this list is to outline the primary outstanding tasks and planned features for a `v1.0.0` release (major release), which will bring ⬖ srcd out of beta.
